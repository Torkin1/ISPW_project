# README - TestContactInfo.side

There are important infos you should know before running TestContactInfoAlert.side:

* A User in DB must exists with **username: daniele** and **password: daniele**;
* At least one published ad must exist in DB;
* At least one Answer to the top ad of ViewFlow page must exist in DB;
* The Answerer of the top answer in CheckAnswers page of that ad must have **email: tt@definetlynotafakemail.net>**

You can tweak these **parameters** inside selenium IDE in order to change targets of test without changing the flow of commands.
